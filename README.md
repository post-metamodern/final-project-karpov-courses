# final-project-karpov-courses

This repository contains two tasks from the final karpov.courses project.

- In the first task I preprocess the data, calculate metrics, and based on that I do A/B testing. I use Python libraries to perform tests and plot graphs.
- In the second task, I connect to the database and create SQL queries to calculate product metrics.

A detailed description of the tasks, as well as the described solution progress, is contained inside the .ipynb files.
